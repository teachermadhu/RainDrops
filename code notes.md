Steps for creating Character Rain Drops :

Step 1: Create a class drop.js from writing the features of drops.

Step 2: we have the following properties: x,y which are at random positions and text to add text at random positions, 
then, add a function draw, update to display my characters on the screen. Add extra 20 to y position, 
as i am making 3 characters continuous to follow a rain effect. 
also, dont forget to call one function inside another. So that we can create a repition. 
repeated draw and update inside each other

Now, call the class drop.js to create a repeated loop for each raindrop and make the display for them.
aslo, create an array letters[], to add all the characters to display use them in properties. 

The output should look like:
